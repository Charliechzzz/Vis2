              Therefore, this visualization will start from introducing primary schools, middle schools, and universities in Western Australia and New South Wales, 
              and based on a comprehensive range of indices to evaluate the local educational level.

       <h3>Primary schools and secondary schools in New South Wales and Western Australia</h3>
       <p>There are some scoring evaluations to present educational level of primary and secondary schools including Bettereducation score and Index of Community Socio-Educational 
         Advantage (ICSEA) score. The following map is to show general educational level of primary schools and secondary schools in Western Australia and New South Wales with Bettereducation score on 2019.

The higher score means better eduacational level and we can see the range of scores
